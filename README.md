# The problem it solves

The Problem of PCOS in India:

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a significant health concern affecting women worldwide, including India. PCOS is a hormonal disorder characterized by irregular periods, elevated levels of male hormones (androgens), and polycystic ovaries. It can lead to various complications, including infertility, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.

Statistics:

1. Prevalence: PCOS is one of the most common endocrine disorders affecting women of reproductive age. In India, the prevalence of PCOS is alarmingly high, with studies estimating that between 9% to 36% of women are affected, varying across different regions and populations.

2. Underdiagnosis: Despite its prevalence, PCOS remains underdiagnosed in India. Many women with PCOS are unaware of their condition due to a lack of awareness, misconceptions, and cultural taboos surrounding reproductive health.

3. Impact on Fertility: PCOS is a leading cause of infertility among women. Studies suggest that approximately 70% of women with PCOS experience infertility due to irregular ovulation or lack of ovulation altogether.

4. Metabolic Complications: PCOS increases the risk of metabolic complications such as insulin resistance, obesity, and dyslipidemia. Studies have shown that women with PCOS in India have a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome compared to women without PCOS.

5. Psychological Effects: PCOS can have significant psychological effects on affected individuals. Women with PCOS in India often face stigma, body image issues, and psychological distress due to symptoms such as hirsutism (excessive hair growth), acne, and infertility.

Brief Overview of the Problem:

PCOS poses a multifaceted challenge in India, impacting women's physical health, reproductive outcomes, and psychological well-being. The high prevalence of PCOS coupled with underdiagnosis and inadequate access to healthcare exacerbates the problem. Lack of awareness, cultural barriers, and social stigma further contribute to delayed diagnosis and suboptimal management of PCOS.

Addressing the problem of PCOS in India requires a comprehensive approach involving public health interventions, healthcare provider education, community outreach programs, and improved access to affordable healthcare services. Empowering women with knowledge about PCOS, promoting early detection, and providing holistic care can mitigate the adverse effects of PCOS and improve the quality of life for affected individuals in India.

# Use Cases

Use Cases of Ova Tracker:

1. Personal PCOS Risk Assessment:
   - Scenario: Priya, a 28-year-old woman, is concerned about her irregular menstrual cycles and acne. She visits the Ova Tracker app and inputs her age, BMI, menstrual cycle regularity, and symptoms.
   - Use Case: Ova Tracker processes Priya's data and generates a personalized PCOS risk assessment, indicating her likelihood of having PCOS based on the input parameters.

2. Early Detection for Preventive Care:
   - Scenario: Neha, a 23-year-old woman, wants to be proactive about her reproductive health. She uses Ova Tracker to assess her PCOS risk even though she doesn't exhibit any symptoms.
   - Use Case: Ova Tracker identifies Neha's elevated risk for PCOS based on her age and other factors, prompting her to seek further evaluation from a healthcare provider for early detection and preventive care.

3. Monitoring PCOS Symptoms:
   - Scenario: Pooja, a 30-year-old woman diagnosed with PCOS, wants to monitor her symptoms and track changes over time.
   - Use Case: Pooja regularly inputs her symptoms and relevant data into Ova Tracker. The app provides insights into the progression of her PCOS symptoms and alerts her to any significant changes, facilitating proactive management and timely intervention.

4. Educational Resource for Awareness:
   - Scenario: Anusha, a college student, wants to learn more about PCOS and its implications for women's health.
   - Use Case: Anusha explores Ova Tracker's educational resources section, which provides information about PCOS, its causes, symptoms, and potential complications. She gains a better understanding of PCOS and its impact, empowering her to make informed decisions about her health.

# Challenges we ran into

**Challenges Faced in Identifying Correct Parameters and Choosing Data:**

1. Parameter Selection Complexity:
   - Brief: One of the primary challenges we encountered was determining the most relevant parameters for predicting PCOS risk accurately. PCOS is a complex syndrome with various symptoms and contributing factors, making it difficult to pinpoint the most crucial parameters for analysis.

2. Data Availability and Quality:
   - Brief: Another significant challenge was sourcing reliable and comprehensive data for parameter analysis. While there is existing research on PCOS, accessing data that aligns with our specific needs and demographics, especially in the Indian context, proved challenging. Ensuring the quality and accuracy of the data was essential to develop a robust prediction model.

3. Population Diversity Consideration:
   - Brief: India is a diverse country with variations in lifestyle, genetics, and environmental factors across different regions and populations. Selecting parameters that adequately capture this diversity and its influence on PCOS risk posed a challenge. We needed to ensure that our prediction model accounted for these variations to provide accurate assessments for all users.

4. Complexity in Model Development:
   - Brief: Building a predictive model that effectively incorporates multiple parameters and accurately predicts PCOS risk required significant expertise and resources. Balancing model complexity with computational efficiency and user-friendliness presented a challenge in the development process.

5. Ethical and Privacy Considerations:
   - Brief: Assembling and utilizing sensitive health data for predictive purposes raised ethical and privacy concerns. Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and implementing robust security measures to safeguard user information were critical challenges.

6. Iterative Refinement Process:
   - Brief: Given the complexity of PCOS and the dynamic nature of health data, identifying the optimal set of parameters and refining the prediction model required an iterative process. Continuously evaluating and updating the model based on feedback and emerging research findings posed a challenge in achieving accuracy and relevance.

Overcoming these challenges involved collaboration among interdisciplinary teams, leveraging domain expertise, and employing advanced data analysis techniques. Despite the complexities, addressing these challenges was essential to developing Ova Tracker into a reliable and effective tool for PCOS prediction and risk assessment.
