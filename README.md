Ova Tracker is a user-friendly, web-based application designed to assess the risk of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in women using machine learning. PCOS is a common hormonal disorder among women of reproductive age, often underdiagnosed due to lack of awareness. It can cause irregular periods, acne, excessive hair growth, and infertility.

This tool empowers women to understand their risk early and seek timely medical advice. Users input basic parameters like age, BMI, menstrual cycle regularity, acne, and hair growth. A Python-based machine learning model processes this data and provides a personalized PCOS risk assessment.

The front end is built with HTML and CSS, while the backend uses Python, Flask, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Pickle. The application ensures privacy and accessibility, functioning across devices and locations.

Key features include:

Personalized PCOS risk report

Educational resources about PCOS

Easy-to-use interface

Secure and confidential data handling

Monitoring and tracking of symptoms

Use cases range from self-assessment and early detection to supporting healthcare consultations and research data collection. The app also promotes PCOS awareness and proactive health management.

Challenges included selecting the right features, ensuring data quality, addressing population diversity, and balancing model complexity with usability.

Ova Tracker aims to fill the awareness gap in PCOS diagnosis and management, particularly in countries like India, where up to 36% of women may be affected. By leveraging technology, the app helps users take control of their reproductive health with ease and confidence.
